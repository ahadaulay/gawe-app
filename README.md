## About GAWE APP

GAWE APP is a web application built using Laravel 10, designed to streamline project management and collaboration between different roles. The application supports three primary roles:

- **Super Admin**: Oversees the entire application, manages users, projects, and settings.
- **Freelancer**: Takes on tasks, manages work schedules, and submits deliverables.
- **Client**: Posts projects, reviews freelancers, and manages contracts.

GAWE APP uses Laravel Breeze to provide a simple and elegant authentication and session management system, ensuring that each role has appropriate access and functionality.
